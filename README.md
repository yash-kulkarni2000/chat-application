### Flow

- User Input: A user types a message in the chat interface.

- Frontend (React): The message is sent to the backend via API.

- Backend (Flask): 
    - The message is passed to the DistilBERT model for classification.
    - If classified as hate speech, the user is warned.
    - The message is also sent to GPT-3.5-Turbo for a reply.

- Output:
    - If classified as hate and the user confirms, the message and chatbot reply are displayed.
    - If classified as hate and user does not confirm, the message is blocked.
    - If not classified as hate, the chatbot reply is displayed.

## Technologies Used
